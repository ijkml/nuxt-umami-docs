## Prevent tracking yourself

To prevent tracking yourself, add `umami.disabled` to your browser’s
localStorage. Set the value to 1.

Go to your website, copy and run this in your browser's console:

```js
localStorage.setItem('umami.disabled', 1);
```

Also, here is a simple plugin I use to "automate" this on mobile and live sites:

```ts [itsmebob.client.ts]
// add to your plugins folder
export default defineNuxtPlugin({
  hooks: {
    'app:beforeMount': async function () {
      const query = useRoute().query;
      if ('itsmebob' in query) {
        const { itsmebob, ...otherParams } = query;
        navigateTo({ query: otherParams });
        window.localStorage.setItem('umami.disabled', '1');
        window.console.info(`Hello, Bob.`);
        // now when visisting your live site for the first time
        // go to example.com?itsmebob
      }
    },
  },
});
```

## Track referrers

Nuxt Umami can automatically use `ref` or `referrer` from the URL parameters
if `document.referrer` is unavailable.

Like `document.referrer`, `ref` must be a full URL (including http).

```
mysite.com?ref=https://example.site

mysite.com?referrer=https://vuejs.org
```

Umami also has built-in support for [UTMs](https://umami.is/docs/guides/measure-campaigns#step-2:-add-utm-parameters-to-your-links).

## FAQs

- **`autoTrack` is not working?**

  The current implementation of autoTrack relies on `<NuxtPage>` being
  present in your app. If you don’t have `<NuxtPage>`, you’d have to
  manually track page-view `onMounted`. [See this issue](https://github.com/ijkml/nuxt-umami/issues/102#issuecomment-2112482840).

- **Welp, I am getting some CORS errors!**

  Some adblockers like uBlock and Ghostery block Umami Cloud’s endpoints.
  Try to disable your adblockers (yes, all of them). Also, double-check
  your config and Umami version. :br You can also use [proxy mode](/api/configuration#proxy-mode) to bypass this.

- **How do I set up my own Umami instance?**

  Miracle Onyenma published a simple guide in his blog. [Check it out](https://m10.live/blog/set-up-analytics-for-your-nuxt-3-app-with-umami){target="blank" referrer="origin"}.

- **FAQs with only 4 questions?**

  Don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/ijkml/nuxt-umami/issues). I'd be happy to help.

- **I want to sponsor this project. How do I?**

  Absolutely, thank you.
